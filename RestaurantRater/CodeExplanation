let fetchRequest: NSFetchRequest<Restaurant> = Restaurant.fetchRequest()
fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "rname == %@", restaurantNameHolder!)

Explain:
These two lines of code create a fetch request for the Restaurant entity, with a predicate that filters the results to only include restaurants with the rname attribute equal to the restaurantNameHolder property value.

NSFetchRequest is a class in Core Data that is used to fetch objects from the persistent store. In this case, fetchRequest is an instance of NSFetchRequest that specifies that we want to fetch objects of type Restaurant. The Restaurant.fetchRequest() method returns an NSFetchRequest object that is pre-configured to fetch objects of the Restaurant entity type.

fetchRequest.predicate sets the predicate for the fetch request, which is a filter that specifies the criteria that objects must match to be returned by the fetch request. In this case, the predicate is created using an NSPredicate object with a format string that specifies that we want to filter the results to only include Restaurant objects where the rname attribute is equal to the value of restaurantNameHolder. The %@ placeholder in the format string is replaced with the value of restaurantNameHolder when the predicate is evaluated

Optional binding is used to safely unwrap optional values. It is a way to check if an optional has a non-nil value, and if it does, to assign that value to a new constant or variable that can be used safely within the scope of the if statement.

Conditional binding, on the other hand, is a way to conditionally execute code based on the result of an optional binding. It is a way to check if an optional has a non-nil value, and if it does, to execute the code inside the if statement.

In the provided code, the first if statement is an example of conditional binding, as it checks if entree?.erating is non-nil and assigns its value to rating if it is. The second if statement is an example of optional binding, as it checks if cell.detailTextLabel?.text is non-nil and assigns its value to existingText if it is.

So the entire expression (entree?.etype ?? "") is a way of safely accessing the etype property of the optional entree variable, and providing a default value of an empty string if the etype property is nil
